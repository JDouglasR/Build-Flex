## __Description__
This group project was created to build our first full-stack app.  This web-app is for users who want to create a running challenge for themselves and keep track of the progress.

### __Installation__
Installation:  You will need to have Node installed and then run ```npm install``` to be able to run.  To run the program locally, you can either install ![Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) or just run ```node server.js```.  After this step, open your browser and navigate to ```localhost:8080```.  This should display the app.
